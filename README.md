Other colous and styles can be used for promotional material. e.g. Canva designs. These do not necessarily need to follow the colour scheme of the logo.

## Logos

### Guild of Students and University of Birmingham Logo

Follow the advice issued by the Guild Of Students on use of the Guild and University logos. 
The advice is available through the Committee Admin page, on the Guild website.

### CSS

In all cases, the full logo should be used. The bold variant should be preferred, where possible, but is not required. They are available in this repository.

## Fonts

For the purposes of recreating the logo:

The font to be used in the logos is the bold variant of [Inconsolata](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inconsolata). The text should always be bold in the logo. 

## Files

The provided `svg`, `eps` and `png` files in this repository should always be used. Where possible the vecor formats should be preffered to maintain quality and ensure the images are rasterised the correct resolution.

There is no need to recreate the logo, except as a last resort.
